# FireEscapeGuidance

This is unity project file. So, You can open it with Unity 18.1.6f version.

Fire alarm bells often ring in our school because of a breakdown.
Every time fire alarm rings in the building, I was thinking about how to get out of this situation, whether to go up or down. 
I thought it was a problem to have to spend time for thinking about how to get out of the building and I decided to change the existing fire alarm system to solve this problem.
In the event of a fire, the receiver receives the place where the fire occurred, so the optimal route can be calculated in each building's room and a system guide the way with the arrows on the wall, except the path where the fire broke out. To find the optimal route, we used the dijkstra algorithm and created the game with Unity for visualization.
